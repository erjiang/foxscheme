FoxScheme

FoxScheme is a Scheme interpreter written in JavaScript.

Some key points include:
  * Minimal native (primitive) procedures
    Only procedures that must be implemented in JS out of necessity (cons) or
    obvious performance reasons (expt) are native. The rest is expected to be
    implemented in pure Scheme, which means less errors in native code.
 
  * Cleanliness and clarity
    FoxScheme is split into many discrete files, each being reasonably
    self-contained. The code attempts to be easily-readable where possible, and
    commented where not, allowing for easy modification and extension.
 
  * Self-containment
    FoxScheme attempts to be software in its own right, and does not rely on
    external libraries such as jQuery or Prototype.js. FoxScheme does its best
    not to pollute the global namespace or otherwise interfere with other JS
    software. There is no dependence on a browser; for example, early
    development was done using Rhino. This makes FoxScheme easy to embed in a
    web page.
 
  * Error-checking
    FoxScheme attempts to error-check as much of the user input as is
    reasonable. Many JS Schemes happily accept invalid syntax and other invalid
    input, which can be confusing to the user.

  * Unit testing
    FoxScheme has a growing unit-test suite using JSSpec that is run after
    every atomic change to the codebase.
 
Known issues:
 
  * Boolean prototype augmented
    Boolean.prototype.toString is defined in src/system/boolean.js, for the
    reason of showing "#t" instead of "true" when coerced into a String by the
    browser. Otherwise, we would either need to create our own FoxScheme.Bool
    object and complicate all boolean testing, or write a new pretty-printer
    layer that must recursively walk the result to print it. This solution
    should not break most other JavaScript software.
 
  * No tail-call optimization
    The current FoxScheme.Interpreter uses native JS recursion. If the
    underlying JS system does not optimize tail calls, then deep recursion will
    max out the underlying system's stack. This will hopefully be solved in the
    future with the addition of a compiler/VM.
 
  * Incomplete
    Currently, only a few native procedures are implemented for things like
    pairs, strings, vectors, and other basic values. There is currently no
    support for continuations, I/O, modules, macros, and so on. Stay tuned.
